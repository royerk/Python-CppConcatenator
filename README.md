# Python-CppConcatenator
Python script to concatenate cpp files into a single file.

**WIP**

# How to

Clone depot, in `cpp_concatenator.py` update paths to your project's folder. Run `python3 cpp_concatenator.py` to merge project to a single file. Use `python3 cpp_concatenator.py | xsel -b` to merge & copy to clipboard (you need to have `xsel` installed).

# To do:
- read class or structure from .h(pp)
- regroup class/struct with .cpp stuff in the merged file
